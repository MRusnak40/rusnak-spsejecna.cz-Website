    <h4>Dear Miss Dover,</h4>
    <p>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
        Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your
        PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) next year. I will answer your
        questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>
    <h4> Starting dates </h5>
        <p>
            We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
            however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a
            semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Spring semester: 15 February</li>
            <li>Summer semester: 1 June</li>
            <li>Fall semester: 1 September</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would
            prefer.
        </p>

        <h4> Subjects of study </h4>
        <p>
            At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research
            facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science
            and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and
            just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the
            ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of
            priority:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
                (C14H12O3.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures
                exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases
                (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</li>
            <li>HTML, Hypertext Markup Language, and CSS,
                Cascading Style Sheets, constructs for representing musical scores.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
            including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and
            other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

        <h4>Exotic dance moves</h4>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I
            did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my
            favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

        <ul>

            <li><strong>Polynesian chicken dance</strong>
                <p></p>
                <p></p> A little known but very influential dance dating back as
                far as
                300 BCE, a whole village would
                dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to
                be "fruitful".
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Icelandic brownian shuffle</strong>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of
                getting warm, they
                used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a
                circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
                tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that
                he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Arctic robot dance</strong>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English
                explorers in
                the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by
                "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern
                Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were
                just moving like this because they were really cold.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
